# DockerBox
Dockerbox is a docker managment tool with features like:
    - User Autentication
    - Built from scratch php API
    - Simple routing system
    - Database interface
    - VueJS dashboard

## Why?
There are multiple tools that use docker to manage machines but none of them are with a easy to use interface, this tool aspires to that.
Our goal is to manage the docker engine with user autentication, with this teachers can manage their students machines and students create and upload code to them.

## Getting Started
Run docker-compose, if you don't have it then grow up and install it ˋsudo apt install docker-compose docker.ioˋ.
Then just turn on the project with 
ˋˋˋ
docker-compose up -d
ˋˋˋ
use -d to run the machines in the background!
